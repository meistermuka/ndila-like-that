title: Getting things started

This is the customary introduction post of any mind dump you find on the internet. There is no particular reason why I chose hexo as a blogging system other than its simplicity and the fact that posts are written using markdown and I like markdown.

You can do ~~fancy~~interesting things with markdown and it makes including
```python
def some_function():
    print('code snippets')
```
a breeze.
